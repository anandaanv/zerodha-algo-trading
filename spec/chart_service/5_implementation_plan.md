# Chart Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the Chart Service component, including testing strategies and milestones.

## Implementation Phases

   - Define all necessary configuration properties
   - Create `ChartType` enum for supported chart types

3. Implement `ComplexChartCreator` for single chart generation
   - Create basic rendering logic for different chart types
   - Implement dataset creation from bar series
   - Add support for indicators in charts

4. Create basic renderer implementations
   - Implement `CandlestickChartRenderer` for OHLC data
   - Implement `LineChartRenderer` for time series data
   - Create `ChartRendererFactory` to select appropriate renderer

5. Implement `ChartServiceImpl` that delegates to `ComplexChartCreator`
   - Implement validation logic for configurations
   - Handle file naming and paths
   - Integrate with chart creation and saving

6. Create `ChartSaveUtil` for saving charts to files
   - Implement timestamp-based filename generation
   - Support both PNG and JPEG formats
   - Create charts directory if it doesn't exist

**Deliverables**:

- Functional chart service for single chart generation
- Support for candlestick and line charts
- Ability to add basic indicators to charts
- Tests for all core functionality

### Phase 2 (Multi-Chart Layout)

**Objective**: Implement multi-chart layout capabilities

**Tasks**:

1. Implement the `ChartGrid` class for 2xN grid layout functionality
   - Create logic to calculate optimal grid dimensions
   - Implement chart arrangement in grid cells
   - Handle scaling and positioning of charts

2. Update `ChartServiceImpl` to use `ChartGrid` for multiple charts
   - Add logic to handle collections of chart configurations
   - Integrate with grid layout for multiple charts
   - Add validation for multi-chart configurations

3. Ensure proper scaling and formatting of the combined chart
   - Implement consistent sizing across charts
   - Add borders between charts
   - Add overall title for combined charts

4. Add support for consistent styling across charts
   - Implement shared color schemes
   - Create uniform axis formatting
   - Standardize font sizes and styles

**Deliverables**:

- Ability to create multi-chart layouts
- Support for 2xN grid arrangements
- Consistent styling across multiple charts
- Tests for grid layout functionality

### Phase 3 (Enhanced Features)

**Objective**: Add advanced features and optimizations

**Tasks**:

1. Add support for more chart types and renderers
   - Implement `AreaChartRenderer` for area charts
   - Add `HollowCandleRenderer` for hollow candles
   - Create `HeikinAshiRenderer` for Heikin-Ashi charts

2. Implement more customization options in `ChartConfig`
   - Add support for custom colors and styles
   - Implement theme-based styling
   - Add options for axis customization

3. Add annotation capabilities
   - Support for trend lines
   - Add support/resistance level markers
   - Implement price level annotations

4. Optimize for performance with large datasets
   - Implement data point reduction for large series
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize rendering for large charts

5. Implement caching of frequently used chart components
   - Cache renderer instances
   - Reuse datasets when possible
   - Implement efficient memory management

**Deliverables**:

- Full range of chart types supported
- Rich customization options
- Annotation capabilities
- Optimized performance for large datasets
- Comprehensive tests for all features

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **ChartService Tests**
   - Test input validation
   - Verify correct delegation to ChartCreator and ChartGrid
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **ChartConfig Tests**
   - Test builder pattern functionality
   - Verify default values are applied correctly
   - Test serialization/deserialization if needed

3. **ComplexChartCreator Tests**
   - Test chart creation with various configurations
   - Verify indicator rendering
   - Test different chart types

4. **ChartGrid Tests**
   - Test layout calculation logic
   - Verify correct grid arrangement of charts
   - Test with different numbers of charts

5. **Renderer Tests**
   - Test each renderer with sample data
   - Verify visual properties are applied correctly
   - Test edge cases (empty data, extreme values)

### Integration Tests

1. **End-to-End Chart Generation**
   - Test the complete flow from configuration to file output
   - Verify chart files are created correctly
   - Test with actual bar series data

2. **Multi-Chart Integration**
   - Test generation of multi-chart layouts
   - Verify correct integration between ChartCreator and ChartGrid
   - Test with various combinations of chart types

3. **Indicator Integration**
   - Test with various combinations of indicators
   - Verify indicators are displayed correctly
   - Test with both overlay and separate panel indicators

### Visual Verification

1. **Manual Chart Inspection**
   - Create test cases that generate various charts
   - Manually verify the visual correctness of the output
   - Check for aesthetic issues not caught by automated tests

2. **Automated Screenshot Comparison**
   - Generate reference images for known configurations
   - Compare generated charts with reference images
   - Flag significant differences for manual review

## Development Approach

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementing functionality
   - Ensure all code is covered by tests
   - Use mocks for external dependencies

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Implement one feature at a time
   - Get each feature working before moving to the next
   - Regular code reviews and refactoring

3. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Document all public APIs before implementation
   - Update documentation as code evolves
   - Ensure all classes and methods have clear documentation

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 1 week
- **Phase 3**: 2 weeks
- **Testing and Refinement**: 1 week

**Total Estimated Time**: 6 weeks
